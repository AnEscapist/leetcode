# Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
How many possible unique paths are there?

**Examples:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right

Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

# Solution:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        dp = [[1 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(1, m):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
        return dp[n-1][m-1]
```
