# Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. 
The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

**Example:**

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

# Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
        """
        :type obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        row = len(obstacleGrid)
        col = len(obstacleGrid[0])
        
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(col)] for _ in range(row)]
        for i in range(row):
            if obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0:
                dp[i][0] = 1
            else:
                break
        for j in range(col):
            if obstacleGrid[0][j] == 0:
                dp[0][j] = 1
            else:
                break
        for i in range(1, row):
            for j in range(1, col):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1:
                    dp[i][j] = 0
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
        return dp[row-1][col-1]
```
