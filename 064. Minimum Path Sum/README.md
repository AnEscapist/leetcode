# Description

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, 
find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:**

You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example:**

```
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```

# Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minPathSum(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        row = len(grid)
        col = len(grid[0])
        
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(col)] for _ in range(row)]
        
        for i in range(row):
            for j in range(col):
                if i == 0 and j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = grid[i][j]
                elif i == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + grid[i][j]
                elif j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j], dp[i][j-1] + grid[i][j])
                    
        return dp[row-1][col-1]
```
